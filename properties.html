        I love technology because it makes my life way easier. There's a lot of
        information available at just the tip of my fingers. I can work from
        home, connect with my friends, have classes, order food and do a whole
        lot from the comfort of my home thanks to technology.</i

      <i
        >There's also the ease of mobility aspect. It's so easy to go from point
        A to point B these days as we have cars, bikes, and even ships and
        airplanes to aid movement. Technology was created to make our lives
        easier and I'm a soft girl who doesn't like stress so why wouldn't I
        love it?</i

      <i
        >So far, I have learnt about <b>GitHub, HTML and CSS.</b> I'm currently
        learning CSS which means <b>Cascading Style Sheets</b> and it plays a
        very important role in web development as it's responsible for styling.
        Without CSS, our web pages would be bland and devoid of color. There are
        three ways to add CSS to your HTML code,
        <b>Inline CSS, Internal CSS styling, and External CSS styling.</b> CSS
        has various selectors including class selector, universal selector, id
        selector, attribute selector etc.
